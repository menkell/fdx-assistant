# Contributing

This repository follows the Gitflow Workflow
(https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
Before contributing, you should familiarize yourself with this workflow,
especially regarding feature branching and pull requests.

## FDX API Release flow

The process we are following for RFC additions for a new FDX release is as follows:

* Confirm that latest release was merged to `main` branch and tagged with that release's version number
* Create a feature branch to update the API release full version:
  * In .fdx_version file: `FDX_VERSION="v6.2.0"`
  * In each API/fdxapi.*.yaml file, lines 3 - 5
    ```yaml
      version: '6.2.0'
      title: FDX V6.2.0 Shared Components API
      description: Financial Data Exchange V6.2.0 Shared Components API
    ```
  * For a major release, also update major version number on lines 14-15
    ```yaml
      - url: 'https://api.fi.com/fdx/v6'
        description: Financial Data Exchange V6 Core API
    ```
* A) Create a PR from the feature branch, review, approve and merge the version update
* B) The merge triggers a pipeline build of a new branch containing yamllint and spectral validations, metrics counting, and zip file creation
* C) If that `feature/build-NNNN` branch contains meaningful changes such as validation errors or new versioned files; create a PR from it, review, approve and merge
* Then for each RFC change in the release:
  * Create a new feature branch for the RFC changes
    * Include any fixes needed for validation errors introduced in last RFC, and
  * Commit RFC feature branch to repository
  * Repeat steps A) - C) for the RFC branch
* After last RFC and branch builds for the release have been merged, then complete the release by:
  * Merge `develop` branch to `main`
  * Tag `main` with the latest version number for the release

All versions after V4.0 will remain in this repository, and releases will be tagged with their version number.

Long-lived errata release versions will become their own branch.

## FDX API Metrics:

For counts of the API elements, see:

* [API_metrics_v6.3.0.md](./API_metrics_v6.3.0.md) 
* [API_metrics_v6.2.0.md](./API_metrics_v6.2.0.md) 
* [API_metrics_v6.1.0.md](./API_metrics_v6.1.0.md) 
* [API_metrics_v6.0.0.md](./API_metrics_v6.0.0.md) 
* [API_metrics_v5.3.3.md](./API_metrics_v5.3.3.md) 

## Gitflow Workflow Example Commands

### Initial Set Up

```bash
# Go to your local code folder
cd dev
# Clone the repository
# Use the Clone button in the upper-right corner of 
# https://bitbucket.org/fdxdev/fdxapi/src/main/
git clone https://yourusername@bitbucket.org/fdxdev/fdxapi.git
```

### For each unit of change being made

### Proposed Branching Model
#### "develop"
* There will be two primary branches - main and develop
* All work is carried out via feature branches
* A feature branch must be created for any new work e.g., modification of a tax form
* A feature branch is always created off the develop branch
* A feature branch is to be named as `feature-<RFC number>-<feature name>` or `feature-<JIRA number>`
* A feature branch must always merge back into develop branch
* All of paths, parameters and schemas sections should be kept in alphabetical order
* Optionally, types should be sorted down to end of schemas section, after all entities (as done in existing main/large yaml files)
* Run ./lint.sh before commits (or at least before PRs) to ensure no new yaml validation errors are introduced
* For newly added yaml files, add the new filename everywhere that yaml files are listed. That includes:   
    * bitbucket-pipelines.yaml
    * lint.sh
    * runlinter.sh

```bash
# Go to develop branch - ALWAYS START HERE IN develop BRANCH!
git checkout develop
# Make sure up-to-date
git pull origin develop

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/rfc-0xxx-short-name

# Edit feature content

# Periodically, integrate any changes
git pull origin develop

# When ready, create pull request for feature.
git add --all
git commit -m "Explanation"
git status
git push origin feature/rfc-0xxx-short-name

# Git will show a link to a pull request form.
# Complete the form. Submit the request.

# After pull request is merged
# Remove your local feature branch

# Go back to develop branch
git checkout develop
# List your local branches
git branch
# Delete the branch
git branch -d feature/rfc-0xxx-short-name 

```

## Legacy Versions

Versions prior to 4.0 were moved to the legacy DD-API repository, https://bitbucket.org/fdxdev/dd-api/src/main/.

## Repository folder structure

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|-------------|
| `/` (root) | Configuration and command files |
| `/API` | Editable source yaml files |
| `/API/reports` | Yamllint and Spectral output report files |
| `/config` | Config and test files for linting and validation |
| `/metrics` | Scripts and files for line-categorizing and counting |

## Bitbucket Pipeline

The repository pipeline build uses FDX Docker images defined at fdxdockerhub/fdx-lint-spectral, which contain yamllint and spectral tools used by scripts below.

See https://hub.docker.com/r/fdxdockerhub/fdx-lint-spectral for more information and all the available tags and their Dockerfile scripts to create them.

The FDX docker image options (as of FDX V6.1.0), both using Spectral v6.11.0. (The tag with 'lts' means the Long Term Support version of node, currently version 20.)

* Using Node v20: **fdx-lint-spectral:lts-slim**
* Node v21: fdx-lint-spectral:slim

Docker image maintenance and changes can be made by:

* Open an FDX Support request with FDX consulting firm Prakat, email fdxsupport@financialdataexchange.org
* Login accounts and credentials are held by Prakat

## Build scripts and validation tools

Scripts and tools which the pipeline uses during the build process:

* Lint and Spectral analysis of yaml files
    * Creation of output reports for each analysis
    * See `fdxlint.sh` and `lint.sh`
* Counting detailed metrics of FDX API files
    * Produces `API_metrics_Vxxx.md` files
    * Scripts are in `/metrics` folder
* Bundling release artifacts as `.zip` archives
    * See `zip_files.sh`

Full description of these tools and how to use them in your own environment are available on FDX Confluence
at [FDX API schema validation tools](https://fdx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FDX/pages/2870476802/FDX+API+schema+validation+tools).

### Adding new scripts

If you are working on a Windows machine and need to commit a new script file to the repository for
execution during a pipeline build, you will need to ensure the file is executable in Linux.

The steps to do that are:

* List files from the command line:
    * `git ls-files -s -- '*.sh'`
*  Executable files look like:
    * `100755 a76112fff719809419b4f4d9cec07085ed691b1a 0       fdxlint.sh`
*  Non-executable files look like:
    * `100644 eac5647de34f973ae49ea4ff55b08a4c5d113a87 0       fdx_new_lint.sh`
        * (instead of starting `100755`)
* To add the executable bits, run command:
    * `git update-index --chmod=+x fdx_new_lint.sh`
* Then add, commit and push the file to repository as usual
